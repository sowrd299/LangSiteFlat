            <p>
            “<b>English-language learners</b>, or ELLs, are students who are unable to communicate fluently or learn effectively in <b>English</b>, who often come from <b>non-English</b> speaking homes and backgrounds, and who typically require specialized or modified instruction in both the <b>English language</b> and in their academic courses.” (edglossary.org)

            <h3>The purpose of English Learning Development (ELD) in America</h3>

            <p>
            “<b>English Language Development (ELD)</b> is a systematic instructional model designed to develop the <b>English language</b> proficiency of <b>English language learners</b> (i.e., students who speak <b>English</b> as a <b>second language</b>)” (eldstrategies.com). These programs are designed to idolize <b>English</b> as the <b>dominant language</b>, thus marginalizing students who speak language(s) other than <b>English</b> in their homes.  By putting these students in <b>ELD</b> programs, they are encouraging <b>cultural determinism</b> within schools; the foundational logic behind <b>ELD</b> programs blames the student’s culture and promotes the myth that, in order to succeed in America, one must be fluent in <b>English</b>. For example, in order to <b>acculturate</b>
 Native Americans to English-speaking American standards in the late 
19th and early 20th century, Richard Pratt would place them into 
boarding schools where they were stripped of their language, culture, 
and identity. The goal with both Pratt’s strategies and <b>ELD</b> strategies is to assimilate students who belong to a non-dominant culture to the <b>dominant English-speaking culture</b>. Rather than embrace cultural difference, American educational institutions value <b>acculturation</b>, and the success of this process allows for greater <b>control</b> over the the once non-English speaking populace.

            <h3>How do institutions plan to acculturate their ELL students?</h3>

            <p>
            In the American educational system, <b>English Language Development (ELD)</b> programs are in place to “fix” the problems that ELL students face. These programs <b>segregate</b> students into “<b>special</b>” classrooms, taking them away from their fundamental course classrooms to learn the most <b>basic English skills</b>.
 Even though ELD classes do not provide a robust language arts 
curriculum, these ELL students are still expected to function at the 
same level and possess the same skills as non-ELL students who are 
attending “normal” classes. In these <b>remedial</b> classes, students learn the <b>bare minimum</b> in order to pass their classes and graduate high school.
            </p>

        <div id="Do ELD programs prepare students for Higher Education?">
            <h3>Do ELD programs prepare students for Higher Education?</h3>

            <p>
            ELD provides <b>English Language Learners</b> with basic <b>English</b> skills, but these programs do not prepare them for college or higher education programs. ELD programs are <b>socially reproductive</b>—that is, ELD perpetuates the idea that non-native English speakers are at a <b>disadvantage</b> and will achieve less than native speakers by teaching ELL students the basic knowledge they will need to maintain <b>low-achieving</b>
 status. Instead of providing ELL students with opportunities to surpass
 academic expectations, ELD repeatedly tests them on the same basic 
knowledge that they learned as children, thus <b>undermining the students’ individual potential</b>.
One of the big issues for ELL students is that many aspire to go to 
college but have not been primed to do so. They are simply taught to 
pass their classes, not prepare for the college admissions process. As a
 method of social reproduction, ELD produces a cycle of English Language
 Learners who <b>do not have the same opportunities for educational advancement</b> and social mobility as their non-ELL peers.<br><br><b>ELD
 programs DO NOT promote bilingualism in education. ELD is optimally 
designed for beginners in English, assimilating them to the dominant, 
English-speaking culture.</b>
