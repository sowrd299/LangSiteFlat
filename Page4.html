            <h3>Bilingual Education</h3>

            <p>
            Bilingual Education allows students to learn in both English
 and a second language. For students who do not speak English, this 
could require going to school where they are exposed to instruction in 
both their native language and in English. One benefit of Bilingual 
Education programs is that students can more comfortably develop their 
English skills while also developing their skills in their native 
language in an inclusive academic setting. It is important that these 
students are not replacing their native language with English; they are 
developing biliteracy. Additionally, Bilingual Education does not view 
the student’s native language as a deficit; the student’s native 
language is instead viewed as a useful skill that can be used in an 
academic setting just as much as English. Students will no longer feel 
like their heritage and language are inferior to English. Dual-immersion
 schools can aid in counteracting the deficit myth which states that 
students who speak a language other than English or who are learning 
English are <i>at risk</i>. <b>1</b>

Additionally, bilingualism has been found to have cognitive benefits and promote awareness of different cultures.<b>2 </b>
 Language has a connection with a culture; dual-immersion schools can 
expose native English speakers to different cultures in addition to 
fostering fluency in a second language. In the end, Bilingual Education 
through dual-immersion schooling promotes multiculturalism through 
content integration—one of Dr. James A. Banks’s five dimensions of 
Multiculturalism—by having a different language added to the curriculum,
 thus integrating a different culture into what is being taught.<b>3 </b><br><br>

            <h3>Some history of Bilingual Education</h3>

            <p>
            </p><ol>
<li><i>Meyer v. Nebraska</i><ol>
<li>1923</li>
<li>Case against an educator who was giving instruction in German outside of school hours to 10 year old students.</li>
<li>The Supreme Court overturned the ruling stating that speaking a 
foreign language would not affect the children’s  “health, morals, or 
understanding”</li>
<li>Stated that Nebraska’s law prohibiting education in a foreign 
language in private language classes was against the Fourteenth 
Amendment.<b>2 </b></li></ol></li>
<i>Farrington v Tokushige</i><ol>
<li>1927</li>
<li>Similar to the case of <i>Meyer v. Nebraska</i></li>
<li>The Supreme Court deemed the efforts made by Hawaiian education 
authorities to restrict after-school language classes in Japanese and 
Chinese unconstitutional. </li>
<li>The government could restrict language instructions in the schools, 
but could not intervene in any private or after-school instruction in 
another language.</li><b>2 </b></ol>
<li>National Defense Education Act<ol>
<li>Passed in 1958</li>
<li>After the Russian launch of the Sputnik satellite to space, there 
was an interest in increasing quality of education. The US became aware 
of the issues with having English as the “melting-pot” language and 
began to favor foreign language instruction to accommodate to the 
increasingly international world.</li>
<li>The National Defence Education Act encouraged foreign language 
instruction in all schools ranging from elementaries to universities.<b>2 </b></li></ol></li>

<li>The Bilingual Education Act<ol>
<li>Passed in 1968 </li>
<li>Made bilingual education part of federal education policy </li>
<li>It allowed the usage of federal funds for the education of </li><li>non-English speakers as they transitioned to English</li>
<li>Undermined the English-only legislation in many states.<b>2 </b></li></ol></li>
<li>Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) Title VII<ol>
<li>The original legislation is from 1965, and it was meant to aid non-English speakers.</li>
<li>It was reauthorized multiple times.</li>
<li>The Bilingual Education Act was one of the amendments made to ESEA in 1968.</li>
<li>The 1974 reauthorization ESEA provided a clearer definition of what 
bilingual education is, and it required teachers to incorporate 
native-language instruction to help students progress. It started 
debates regarding how much of a student’s native language should be 
allowed in school. Some argued that it was beneficial to teach students 
in their native language while others argued that schools needed to 
teach students English as early as possible. The reauthorization 
prohibited dual- immersion programs. Instead, it favored transitional 
bilingual education programs, which only teaches students in their 
native language in order to encourage them to learn English before 
transitioning to English-only instruction.</li>
<li>The 1978 reauthorization lifted the ban on dual immersion programs but still favored transitional bilingual education programs. </li>
<li>The 1984 and 1988 reauthorizations gave more funds to programs in 
which students’ native languages were not used, and they allowed 
“support for more developmental and maintenance program models.” <b>2 </b></li></ol></li>
<li><i>Lau v. Nichols</i><ol>
<li>1970</li>
<li>Court case of a Chinese students against the San Francisco School District</li>
<li>Put into question whether non-English speakers had the equal 
educational opportunities if they were given English-only instruction.</li>
<li>Supreme Court ruled that “There is no equality of treatment merely 
by providing students with the same facilities, textbooks, teachers and 
curriculum; for students who do not understand English are effectively 
foreclosed from any meaningful education.” The case showed that schools 
need to implement more equity over equality.<b>2 </b></li></ol></li>
<li> Proposition 227<ol>
<li>Passed on June 2, 1998 by a margin of  61% to 39%</li>
<li>Prop. 227 outlawed bilingual education and dual-immersion schools in California.</li>
<li>It aimed to push students into learning English “by being taught in 
English” as quickly as possible so they could supposedly have better 
employment and economic opportunities.</li>
<li>Similar propositions started passing in other states following Prop. 227.<b>2 </b></li></ol></li>
<li>Proposition 58<ol>
<li>Passed on November 8, 2016 <b>4 </b></li>
<li>Repealed Prop. 227, making bilingual education accessible again without a special waiver from parents. <b>4 </b></li>
<li>Prop. 58 is the reason why there are now dual-immersion schools.</li></ol></li></ol>
